Repo is a repository like a file folder in the explorer under my account. 
Branching lets generate different versioning of a repository at one time.
By default, your repository has one branch named main that is considered to be the definitive branch. You can create additional branches off of main in your repository.
Branching is helpful when you want to add new features to a project without changing the main source of code. The work done on different branches will not show up on the main branch until you merge it, which we will cover later in this guide. You can use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to main.

When you create a branch off the main branch, you're making a copy, or snapshot, of main as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the main branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.
The main branch
A new branch called feature: See https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world#creating-a-branch
The journey that feature takes before it's merged into main
Diagram of the two branches. The "feature" branch diverges from the "main" branch, goes through stages for "Commit changes," "Submit pull request," and "Discuss proposed changes," and is then merged back into main.

It is done by a collaborator to take a fork from the main branch to edit a part of the code or add files. 
Pull requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. 
When you open a pull request, you're proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. 
Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in different colors.
As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.
In this step, you'll open a pull request in your own repository and then merge it yourself. It's a great way to practise the GitHub flow before working on larger projects.
Merging a Pull request: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world#step-5-merge-your-pull-request
When you are ready to merge the pulled changes to main branch this is done to merge the changes to main branch.
